					&lt;p&gt;HTML semantics can be a controversial topic and open to interpretation. Most of the times marking is not for the coder or the user, but machines, browsers or a colleague who is working in the same project. Some elements might have more than one purpose than the name itself. The article tag, for example, it's not just for a piece of text, but for any independent entity, that could or could not be arrenged with something else, but it's a thing on it's own. The example used in the text is the use of the article for a piece clothe, to be used in a e-commerce site. &lt;/p&gt;

			<p>Semantics in HTML5 is an opinionated topic, but there are many reasons why semantics is important when coding. It gives coding more meaning, more accessibility, it improves visibility and, according to the speaker, the most important feature of semantics is interoperability, which allow computers to read the code and "talk" to other machines. The "king in town used to be div, but div doesn't have any meaning. With HTML5, there are different kinds of tags such as header, nav, article, section, aside, footer. Sometimes semantics has no impact on how the user perceives the information on the page, but it's important for machine reading, such as phones or Google. That would be the case with the tags bold and strong. For the user, it's the same thing. But the strong tag signals to the machines that there is a strong emphasis on that text.
