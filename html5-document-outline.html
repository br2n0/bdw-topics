					<p>HTML document outline can be useful for accessability reasons or to make your content easier to syndicate. One way to picture the HTML outline is to imagine your page as a table of content. You list the most important sections as individual items and then list interior sections nested within them. HTML5 examines how section and heading structure within a document. It starts with a body tag and establishes that as the outline's section root. Each time a new section is made another element is added to the outline. The heading is used to name a section. These elements create a new section: 

					<p>	article </p>

					<p>	aside </p>

					<p>	section</p>

					<p>	nav </p>


					 </p>

 		<h2>HTML5 and the document outlining algorithm
</h2> <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/08/16/html5-and-the-document-outlining-algorithm/"> Source </a></p>


			<p>There are two things that affects the outline of a webpage. Heading content (h1 to h6) and sectioning content (section, article, nav, aside). Before HTML5, the structure would follow the levels of the headings. Each heading would create it's new implicit section, that would end whenever a new heading would start. Now, sectioning content allows the creation of explicit sections.  Sections also may contain headings of any rank, but webdevelopers are encouraged to use only H1 elements.
